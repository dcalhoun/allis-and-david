![Allis & David](/images/allis-and-david-stairs.jpg)

David & Allis met for the first time in February 2012 when their mutual friend, Sadie, invited
Allis to visit her small group. David, leaning against the kitchen pantry
clutching his Nalgene, immediately perked up as Allis entered the room for the
first time. Allis took note of him. She continued to visit the small group,
becoming part of the close-knit group. Jump forward to May 2012
to find David asking Allis to a show at the High Watt. Allis said yes & off
they went. The two made things official on August 12, 2012.

David asked Allis to marry him a year & a half later on the patio of Caffé Nonna, one their
favorite restaurants.
